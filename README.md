# Eventer

EVENTER 

Software for the detection of spontaneous synaptic events

Requires toolboxes:
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
Parallel Toolbox (EventerGUI only)
AppDesigner

This software was written and designed using MATLAB R2018b

INSTALL guide
Download and unzip the code
Add the eventer folder with all subdirectories to the MATLAB path
Start 'appdesigner', open the eventerapp.mlapp file and then click RUN.


DISCLAIMER
The matlab files included in this analysis toolbox I have written on-and-
off over the years for the purposes of facilitating the analysis of my own 
(and my lab's) electrophysiology data, mainly spontaneous and evoked synaptic 
currents or potentials. As and when I had a specific analysis task I would 
write a new script or function and attempt to bolt them on to one another 
to create a modular analysis toolbox. Some of the code is good but some of 
it is really ugly, and if I were to do it all again (which I am not!), I 
certainly would have done it differently. That said I still use much of it 
and am providing it to embrace open access without responsibility for it's 
use (or misuse). The toolbox does not have a GUI and is not user friendly 
(especially if you are not that familiar with Matlab) and it lacks tutorials 
or a comprehensive manual. That said, I have tried to write extensive help 
information for each script/function in this toolbox. Researchers I know 
who have learnt to use this analysis toolbox like it and still use it today. 
I will attempt to keep up with requests for help and for bug fixes but I do 
not plan to add much more in the way of functionality.
