Matlab-PatchMaster
==================

Matlab functions for importing and dealing with Patchmaster data for electrophysiology.

These functions are known to work for Patchmaster versions 2x73.1 through 2x90.1. They will most likely work on later versions, but I haven't tested that.

Start with the Import folder, which contains ImportPatchData, which calls on SplitSeries and ImportHEKAtoMat.

AnalyzePatchData and the rest of the functions in the Analysis folder are currently a work in progress for my specific analyses.
