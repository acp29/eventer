Note regarding the use of matcfs64c.mexw64

- 64 bit mex file for Matlab to interface to cfs files 
(using CFS64c.dll).

There is a tendency to use the same name for both
32 bit and 64 bit versions of programs, where they are
"compatible" (ie no additional functionality specifically
for 64 bits is offered over the 32 bit version).  

CED have done this with CFS32.dll, but I find this very confusing,
so I have recompiled cfs.c (version 2.70) to CFS64c.dll.

The Matlab nomenclature is clearer.  I have chosen 
matcfs64c to indicate that this a compatible version,
so no 64bit-specific variables have been used.

matcfs64c.mexw64 should be put in a directory in the
Matlab path, along with CFS64c.dll version as supplied.

The mex file can be tested using the m files included,
namely cfsRead64c and cfsWriteRL64c.
